0. The following steps to be done inside the instance terminal. 
	-> To access the terminal in your local ubuntu terminal:
		-> sudo ssh -v -i <your-security.pem file name> ubuntu@<AWS instance publicIP address>

1. We will pull the docker image from the ayush5588 using command (if the image is not present in the local machine)
	-> If 1st time accessing the instance terminal, then need to install the docker. See the following link to see the steps:
		-> https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04
	-> sudo docker login
	-> sudo docker pull ayush5588/nginx-node-practice   # This command can also be found on the image page on docker hub

2. Make sure that the image has been pulled. 
	-> sudo docker images

3.  Then we will run 4 instances (containers) of the pulled image. 
	-> sudo docker run -d --name <give name to the container> -p 2222:5000 <We will be exposing the container 5000 port as 2222> ayush5588/nginx-node-practice:latest
	-> Repeat the above step 3 more times with replacing 2222 by 3333 and 4444 and 5555.

4. Install the nginx in the ubuntu if not installed.

5. Copy the nginx-conf.txt file to /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

6. Check the syntax of the nginx.conf with -> sudo nginx -t. (Testing to be done in the /etc/nginx directory)

7. Run the nginx.conf file.
	-> sudo nginx -s reload.
	-> The step 6 and 7 need to be always executed when there is any change in the nginx.conf file.

8. If using aws, then get the public ip address of the ec2 instance that you are running. Then paste that in the browser.
